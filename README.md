# History
 In 2009 I had some free time during weekend and decided to try to develop a small JVM interpreter which could be used under J2ME CLDC 1.0 because that platform didn't have any ClassLoader support but it was very useful to load compiled class files through network and execute them. The Development of proof of concept took about 3 days and worked with good speed even on Nokia 6100. The project was published as OSS project on my home page as "M-JVM" and even had some interest from mobile community.   
 In 2015 I decided to rework my home page and remove the old project from there, but because it can be useful for someone, I made some refactoring and moved it to GitHub as J-J-JVM project. I have strongly improved the project, now it supports inner classes, double and long values, has a lot of tests. The Library is compatible with Android API 2.0r1.
